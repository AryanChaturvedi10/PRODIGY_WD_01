Project Structure
.
├── landingpage.html    # The main HTML file defining the structure and content of the landing page.
├── landingpage.css     # Custom CSS rules, primarily for applying the 'Inter' font, header scroll effects, modal transitions, and pricing button hover states.
└── landingpage.js      # JavaScript file containing all the client-side logic for interactive components.

Setup and Running Locally
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd finpay-landing-page # Replace with your actual directory name if different

Open landingpage.html in your web browser:
You can simply double-click the landingpage.html file, or right-click and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser.

No special server setup or build process is required as this is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website.

Customization
Content: All text content, images (placeholders), and links can be directly edited within landingpage.html.

Styling:

Tailwind CSS: Most of the styling is handled by Tailwind CSS classes directly in the HTML. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for more customization options.

landingpage.css: For any custom CSS rules that extend beyond Tailwind's utility classes (e.g., font imports, specific transitions not easily done with Tailwind), modify landingpage.css.

JavaScript: The landingpage.js file contains the core logic for interactive components. You can modify or extend this file to add new functionalities or alter existing ones.
